\title{Sets up gear parameters from Ecopath catch data}
\usage{
addEcopathCatchTotal(params, ecopath_catch, sel_func = "sigmoid_length")
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{ecopath_catch}{The Ecopath Catch data frame}
}
\value{
A MizerParams object with gear parameters set up and fishing effort
switched on.
}
\description{
Uses the Catch data frame exported by Ecopath to set up gear parameters.
Currently this sets up only a single gear for the total catch. The
\code{yield_observed} gear parameter is set to the total catch for each species.
The \code{catchability} is set to the ratio of the observed yield to the observed
biomass. The selectivity of the gear is set to be sigmoidal with 50\% of
fish selected at maturity size and 25\% selected at 90\% of maturity size
(measured in weight). Fishing is turned on with an initial effort of 1. The
result will therefore not be at steady state yet.
}
\details{
The catchability set by this function for each gear will be an
underestimation of the catchability needed to produce the observed yield
because setting it to the ratio of the observed yield to the observed biomass
neglects that some of the biomass will be at sizes that are not fully
selected by the gear. You will need to call \code{matchCatch()} to adjust the
catchability to match the observed yield.
