\title{Sets up gear parameters from Ecopath catch data}
\usage{
addEcopathCatchTotal(params, ecopath_catch, sel_func = "sigmoid_length")
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A \code{\link{MizerParams}} object created with species parameters, typically including output from \code{addEcopathParams()}.}

\item{ecopath_catch}{The Ecopath Catch data frame}

\item{sel_func}{A string indicating the selectivity function to use. Either \code{"sigmoid_length"} (default) or \code{"double_sigmoid_length"}.}
}
\value{
A MizerParams object with gear parameters set up and fishing effort
switched on.
}
\description{
Uses the Catch data frame exported by Ecopath to set up gear parameters for a
simplified "total" gear across all fleets. The \code{yield_observed} gear parameter
is set to the total catch for each species, and \code{catchability} is initially set
to the ratio of yield to biomass. This provides a starting point for fishing
pressure, but does not yet ensure steady-state or matched yield.
}
\details{
The selectivity function is specified via the \code{sel_func} argument:
\itemize{
\item If \code{sel_func = "sigmoid_length"} (default), gear selectivity is a classic
sigmoidal function based on body length. The 50\% selection point is set at
maturity size (\code{w_mat}), and 25\% selection occurs at 90\% of maturity size
(measured in weight).
\item If \code{sel_func = "double_sigmoid_length"}, a dome-shaped selectivity curve is
used. This is the product of two sigmoidal functions: one rising (as above)
and one falling. The descending limb reaches 50\% selectivity at the species'
maximum length (\code{Length}) and 25\% selectivity at 110\% of that length. This
pattern reflects fishing that avoids very large individuals (e.g. due to
gear selectivity or behaviour).
}

In both cases, fishing is switched on with an initial effort of 1. However, the
result is not guaranteed to be at steady state, and catchability will generally
need further adjustment. You should call \code{matchCatch()} to refine catchability
and match the observed Ecopath yields.

The \code{sel_func} argument specifies the form of the length-based selectivity function:
\itemize{
\item \code{"sigmoid_length"} (default): Classic sigmoidal selectivity based on length, with 50\% selectivity at maturity length (\code{w_mat}) and 25\% at 90\% of that length (measured in weight).
\item \code{"double_sigmoid_length"}: A bell-shaped (dome-shaped) selectivity curve constructed by multiplying two sigmoid functions. The first sigmoid rises to 50\% selection at maturity length (\code{w_mat}) and reaches 25\% selection at 90\% of that length. The second sigmoid falls, reaching 50\% selection at the maximum observed length (\code{Length}) and 25\% at 110\% of that length. This mimics fisheries that avoid very large individuals (e.g. due to escape or avoidance behaviour).
}

When \code{sel_func = "double_sigmoid_length"}, the additional columns \code{l50_right} and \code{l25_right} are automatically added to the gear parameters, and are calculated from \code{species_params$Length}.
