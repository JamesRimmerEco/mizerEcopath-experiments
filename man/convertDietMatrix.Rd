\title{Convert a proportional diet matrix to absolute consumption}
\usage{
convertDietMatrix(diet_matrix, params, min_w_pred, max_w_pred)
}
\arguments{
\item{diet_matrix}{A numeric matrix where rows correspond to predator species
and columns to prey species (plus an optional "other" column). Rows must sum
to 1. Should include all model species as both row and column names.}

\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{min_w_pred}{The minimum weight of predators to include in the diet
matrix. Default is 0.}

\item{max_w_pred}{The maximum weight of predators to include in the diet
matrix. Default is \code{Inf}.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix with dimensions \link{n_species x n_species}, giving
absolute consumption rates (g/year) for each predatorâ€“prey pair.
}
\description{
This internal helper function converts a diet matrix expressed in proportions
(i.e. each row summing to 1) into a matrix of absolute consumption
(i.e. biomass consumed per year), based on the species' total consumption
rates. It also restricts the matrix to include only the modelled species
(i.e. drops the "other" column and any unmatched rows). The conversion is done
by multiplying each row of the input diet matrix by the total consumption of the
corresponding predator species. This gives the absolute biomass consumed by each
predator from each prey.

This functions is intended for internal use and is called by \code{matchDiet()}.
