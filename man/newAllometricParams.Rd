\description{
This function sets up a model with allometric encounter and mortality rates
for each species and no interaction between the species or with the resource.
The initial abundances are set to the steady-state abundances with the total
biomass for each species matched to observations.
The metabolic respiration rate, the feeding level and the reproduction level
are set to zero.
}
\details{
If the exponent n of the power-law encounter rate is not provided as a species
parameter, it is set to 0.7. The exponent d of the power-law mortality rate is
\emph{always} imposed as n - 1, regardless of any supplied value.

If the species parameter \code{alpha}, which gives the proportion of the consumption
that is assimilated, is not provided, it is set to 0.8, the default value
used by Ecopath.

The coefficient of the power-law encounter rate for each species is chosen so
that the species grows to maturity size by its maturity age. The coefficient
of the power-law mortality rate is computed from the growth rate (using
\code{getEGrowth()}), and is chosen so that the#' juvenile biomass density has a
slightly negative slope.

The species uses \code{matchGrowth()} to adjust the encounter rate coefficient to
produce the desired growth rate. It uses \code{matchBiomasses()} to match the
biomass to the observations and \code{steadySingleSpecies()} to set the model to
steady state.

Because the model does not make use of the resource spectrum, the resource
dynamics is switched off.
