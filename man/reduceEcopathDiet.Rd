\title{Reduce Ecopath diet matrix to mizer species}
\usage{
reduceEcopathDiet(species_params, ecopath_diet)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_params}{A data frame with mizer species parameters}

\item{ecopath_diet}{The Ecopath diet matrix, as exported by the Ecopath
software.}
}
\value{
A matrix with dimnames \code{predator} and \code{prey}, where the row names are
the species names of the predators and the column names are the species
names of the prey, an extra column "other" for groups not included in the model.
The matrix entries give for each predator the proportion of its diet that comes
from each prey species or from other ecosystem components.
}
\description{
Aggregates a group-level Ecopath diet matrix to the species level defined in a mizer model,
using a mapping dictionary from Ecopath groups (e.g. juvenile/adult stanzas) to a single mizer species.
Produces a species-by-species diet matrix, including an \code{"other"} category to account
for diet contributions from Ecopath groups not included in the model.
}
\examples{
# Generate a reduced diet matrix
diet_matrix <- reduceEcopathDiet(
    species_params = species_params_example,
    ecopath_diet = ecopath_diet_example
)

# View first few rows of the result
head(diet_matrix)
}
