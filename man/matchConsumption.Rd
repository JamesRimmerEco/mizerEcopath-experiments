\title{Match the consumption of the model to the Ecopath consumption}
\usage{
matchConsumption(params, species = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{species}{A vector of species names or indices. If NULL, all species for
which the species parameter \code{ecopath_consumption} is provided are affected.}
}
\value{
A MizerParams object with adjusted encounter and metabolic respiration
rates.
}
\description{
This function sets the metabolic respiration rate so that the consumption
matches the species parameter \code{ecopath_consumption}, while keeping the same
energy available for growth and reproduction. Thus the function also adjusts
the external encounter rate to compensate for the changed respiration rate.
To do this the function assumes that both the encounter rate and the metabolic
respiration rate are given by power laws with the same exponent \code{n}, so it
sets the species parameter \code{p} to the same value as \code{n}.
}
\details{
Any of the selected species for which \code{ecopath_consumption} is NA will be
quietly ignored.
If for any species the production is higher than the \code{ecopath_consumption},
then this would lead to a negative metabolic respiration rate. In this case
the metabolic rate is set to 0 and a warning for all such species.
}
\examples{
params <- matchConsumption(celtic_params)
# The consumption now matches the observation
all.equal(getConsumption(params),
          species_params(params)$ecopath_consumption,
          check.attributes = FALSE)
# The energy available for growth and reproduction is not changed
all.equal(getEReproAndGrowth(params),
          getEReproAndGrowth(celtic_params))
