\title{Match observed catch, yield and production with a double‑sigmoid selectivity}
\usage{
matchCatch(
  params,
  species = NULL,
  catch,
  lambda = 2.05,
  yield_lambda = 1,
  production_lambda = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A \code{MizerParams} object}

\item{species}{The species for which to match the catch. Optional. By default
all target species are selected. A vector of species names, or a numeric
vector with the species indices, or a logical vector indicating for each
species whether it is to be selected (TRUE) or not.}

\item{catch}{A data frame containing the observed binned catch data. It must
contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{length}: The start of each bin.
\item \code{dl}: The width of each bin.
\item \code{count}: The observed count for each bin.
}}

\item{lambda}{The slope of the community spectrum. Default is 2.05.}

\item{yield_lambda}{A parameter that controls the strength of the penalty for
deviation from the observed yield.}

\item{production_lambda}{A parameter that controls the strength of the penalty
for deviation from the observed production.}
}
\value{
A MizerParams object with the adjusted external mortality, gear
selectivity, catchability and steady-state spectrum for the selected
species.
}
\description{
This function adjusts the gear‐selectivity and mortality parameters for one
species so that a steady‑state model reproduces the observed catch size
distribution, the observed yield and the observed production, if available.
}
\details{
Currently this function is implemented only for the case where there is a
single gear catching each species.

A \emph{double‑sigmoid} (dome‑shaped) selectivity function is used, as in
\code{mizer::double_sigmoid_length()}.  Four key points define the curve:

\code{l50} – length at 50 \% \emph{ascending} selectivity
\code{l25} – length at 25 \% \emph{ascending} selectivity (\code{ratio = l25 / l50}, < 1)
\code{l50_right} – length at 50 \% \emph{descending} selectivity
\code{l25_right} – length at 25 \% \emph{descending} selectivity
(\code{r_right = l25_right / l50_right}, > 1)

When \code{l50_right == l50} \emph{and} \code{r_right == 1}, the curve collapses to the
ordinary single‑sigmoid.

Only the parameters of the selected species are adjusted. The function then
recalculates the corresponding rate arrays in the params object. It sets the
initial size spectrum to the steady state size spectrum. The total biomass of
each species remains unchanged.

The function estimates these parameters by minimizing an objective function.
The objective function is the negative log likelihood of the observed catch
size distribution given the probabilities predicted by the model plus the sum
of squares difference between the log of the observed yield and the log of
the predicted yield, multiplied by \code{yield_lambda}, as well as the sum of
squares difference between the log of the observed production and the log of
the predicted production, multiplied by \code{production_lambda}.

The function deals with missing data in the following way, for each species
individually:
\itemize{
\item If the observed yield is not available, the function will only match the
observed catch size distribution and the observed production.
\item If the observed production is not available, the function will only match the
observed catch size distribution and the observed yield.
\item If the observed catch size distribution is not available, the function will
only match the observed yield and the observed production.
\item If neither the observed yield nor the observed production are available, the
function raises an error.
}

The catch predicted by the model is calculated by integrating the
catchability and the gear selectivity over the size distribution of the
species. The size distribution itself is shaped by the model through the
interplay between growth and mortality. This is why the gear selectivity and
catchability need to be adjusted together with the other parameters that
shape the size distribution.

The objective function is coded in C++ and the TMB package is used to compile
the objective function and to create functions for automatically calculating
the gradients. These are then passed to the \code{nlminb} function to minimize the
objective function.

params <- matchCatch(celtic_params, species = "Hake", catch = celtic_catch)
plot_catch(params, species = "Hake", catch = celtic_catch)
# The function leaves the biomass of the species unchanged
all.equal(getBiomass(params), getBiomass(celtic_params), tol = 1e-4)
# It also leaves the energy available to an individual for reproduction
# and growth unchanged
all.equal(getEReproAndGrowth(params), getEReproAndGrowth(celtic_params))
# The initial size spectrum is set to the steady state size spectrum
params_steady <- steadySingleSpecies(params)
all.equal(initialN(params), initialN(params_steady))
