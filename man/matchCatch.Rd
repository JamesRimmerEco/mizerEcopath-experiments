\title{Match the observed catch and yield}
\usage{
matchCatch(params, species = NULL, catch, yield_lambda = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{A MizerParams object}

\item{species}{The species for which to match the catch. Optional. By default
all target species are selected. A vector of species names, or a numeric
vector with the species indices, or a logical vector indicating for each
species whether it is to be selected (TRUE) or not.}

\item{catch}{A data frame containing the observed binned catch data. It must
contain the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{length}: The start of each bin.
\item \code{dl}: The width of each bin.
\item \code{count}: The observed count for each bin.
}}

\item{yield_lambda}{A parameter that controls the strength of the penalty for
deviation from the observed yield.}
}
\value{
A MizerParams object with the adjusted gear selectivity and
catchability for the selected species
}
\description{
This function adjusts various model parameters for the selected species so
that the model in steady state reproduces the observed catch size
distribution and the observed yield.
}
\details{
Currently this function is implemented only for the case where there is a
single gear catching each species.

The function sets new values for the following parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{l50}: The size at which the gear selectivity is 50\%.
\item \code{l25}: The size at which the gear selectivity is 25\%.
\item \code{catchability}: The catchability of the gear.
\item \code{mu_mat}: The external mortality at maturity.
\item \code{w_mat25}: The size at which 25\% of individuals are mature.
It uses these to recalculate the corresponding rate arrays in the params
object. It sets the initial size spectrum to the steady state size spectrum.
The total biomass of each species remains unchanged. Only the selected
species are adjusted.
}

The function estimates these parameters by minimizing an objective function.
The objective function is the negative log likelihood of the observed catch
size distribution given the probabilities predicted by the model plus the sum
of squares difference between the log of the observed yield and the log of
the predicted yield, multiplied by \code{yield_lambda}.

The catch predicted by the model is calculated by integrating the
catchability and the gear selectivity over the size distribution of the
species. The size distribution itself is shaped by the model through the
interplay between growth and mortality. This is why the gear selectivity and
catchability need to be adjusted together with the other parameters that
shape the size distribution.

The objective function is coded in C++ and the TMB package is used to compile
the objective function and to create functions for automatically calculating
the gradients. These are then passed to the \code{nlminb} function to minimize the
objective function.

\examples{
params <- matchCatch(celtic_params, species = "Hake", catch = celtic_catch)
plot_catch(params, species = "Hake", catch = celtic_catch)
# The function leaves the biomass of the species unchanged
all.equal(getBiomass(params), getBiomass(celtic_params), tol = 1e-4)
# It also leaves the energy available to an individual for reproduction
# and growth unchanged
all.equal(getEReproAndGrowth(params), getEReproAndGrowth(celtic_params))
# The initial size spectrum is set to the steady state size spectrum
params_steady <- steadySingleSpecies(params)
all.equal(initialN(params), initialN(params_steady))
