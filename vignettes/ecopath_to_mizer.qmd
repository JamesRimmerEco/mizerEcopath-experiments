## Introduction

An Ecopath model requires the user to specify for each group $i$
included in the model the following parameters:

-   Biomass $B_i$
-   Consumption $Q_i$
-   Production $P_i$
-   Fishery catch $C_i$
-   The diet composition matrix $DC_{ij}$

One of the first three parameters above can be replaced by the
"Ecotrophic Efficiency" $EE$, because Ecopath can then deduce the
missing parameter, see below.

We want to use this information to create a mizer model that in its
steady state has the same values for the above parameters. The challenge
is that mizer, which is a size-structured model, is parametrized
differently. Instead of specifying properties at the group level, we
specify parameters at the level of the individual and these parameters
are size-dependent. In this document we will discuss how we deduce mizer
parameters from the Ecopath parameters.

An Ecopath model usually includes a large number of ecosystem components
(called groups), only some of which it would be appropriate to model
explicitly in mizer. We will therefore need to select a subset of the
Ecopath groups to include in the mizer model. Everything else we will
treat as external forcing on the mizer model. So the groups that we do
not include in the mizer model will still be sources of consumption and
of mortality for the groups that we do include.

In cases where a species in the Ecopath model is split into several
stanzas, the rates for the stanzas can be added together to get the
total rate for the species. Mizer then decides itself how the rate is
distributed over the mizer size classes.

The Ecopath parameters give us no direct information on the size
structure of the populations. Therefore we supplement the Ecopath
parameters with information about the size structure of the catches.
This information is usually readily available from fishery-based
observations.

We furthermore make some allometric assumptions, i.e., we assume that in
the steady state the following parameters for an individual of weight
$w$ scale as a power of that weight:

-   The consumption rate
-   The metabolic respiration rate
-   The mortality rate
-   The rate at which a mature individual invests in reproduction

Of course, when we turn on the dynamics of the mizer model (which
corresponds to going from Ecopath to Ecosim) and leave the steady state,
the rates will change in response to changes in the abundances of prey
and predators.

## Definition of the Ecopath parameters

To start, we need to understand the definition of the Ecopath parameters
and how to calculate their values in a mizer model. Each of these
parameters has a value for each Ecopath component (or mizer species). We
indicate that by an index $i$.

### Biomass

The biomass parameter $B_i$ in Ecopath is the total biomass of all the
individuals in the group $i$ in the model. In mizer, the total biomass
of a species is given by integrating over all sizes:
$$B_i = \int_{w_0}^{w_{max}} N_i(w) w dw,$$where $N_i(w)$ is the number
density of the species $i$ at size $w$. This is calculated by
`mizer::getBiomass()`.

### Consumption

The consumption rate parameter $Q$ in Ecopath is the total rate at which
all the individuals taken together consume food. In mizer, this is
calculated as $$Q_i = \int_{w_0}^{w_{max}} q_i(w) N_i(w) dw,$$where
$q_i(w)$ is the consumption rate of an individual of species $i$ and
weight $w$ (calculated with `getFeedingLevel()`) and $N_i(w)$ is the
number density of species $i$ at weight $w$. This is calculated with
`getConsumption()`.

Irrelevant detail: in mizer the individual consumption rate is split
into two factors: $q_i(w)=E_{e.i}(w)(1-f_i(w))$ where $E_{e.i}(w)$ is
the encounter rate of an individual of species $i$ and weight $w$, and
$f_i(w)$ is its feeding level.

### Production

The production rate parameter $P$ in Ecopath is the rate at which
biomass would be accumulated if there were no mortality. Thus the
production rate includes the somatic production rate that is due to
growth of individuals and it includes the rate at which offspring
biomass is produced during reproduction. It does not include the full
rate of gonad production because most of that is lost during the
inefficient reproduction process.

#### Somatic production

The rate at which biomass is created through somatic growth is

$$
P_{s.i} = \int_{w_0}^{w_{max}} g_i(w) N_i(w) dw,
$$

where $g_i(w)$ is the somatic growth rate of an individual of species
$i$ and weight $w$ (calculated with `getEGrowth`) and $N_i(w)$ is the
number density of species $i$ at weight $w$. This is calculated with
`getSomaticProduction()`.

#### Offspring production

In mizer the rate at which offspring are produced is calculated from the
rate of gonad production via a non-linear function. This rate is
returned by `getRDD()`. To get the rate at which this offspring
production adds biomass to the group this rate needs to be multiplied by
the weight of an individual offspring. The resulting rate is returned by
`getOffspringProduction()`.

The total production obtained by summing the somatic production and the
offspring biomass production is returned by `getProduction()`.

### Catch

The Catch rate parameter $C_i$ in Ecopath is the rate at which biomass
of group $i$ is removed by fishing. This should include landings as well
as the part of the discards that does not survive. In mizer, this rate
is calculated with `mizer::getYield()`.

The Ecopath model may disaggregate the catch into the catch by
individual gears or fleets. This is calculated in mizer with
`mizer::getYieldGear()`.

### Diet composition

The diet composition matrix $DC_{ij}$ gives the proportion of the
consumption of group $i$ that is made up of group $j$. So

$$
Q_i = \sum_j DC_{ij}\cdot B_j.
$$

Therefore it also gives the proportion of the predation loss of species
$j$ that is due to predator species $i$:

$$
M2_j\cdot B_j = \sum_i B_i\cdot DC_{ij}.
$$

## Master equations

Ecopath has two master equations that ensure that all biomass is
accounted for. They are thus also referred to as mass balance equations.
These are of course also true in mizer.

### First master equation

The first master equation expresses the fact that consumed biomass will
either contribute to the biomass production or it will be used up in
respiration or it will remain unassimilated:

$$
Q_i = P_i + R_i + U_i.
$$

Here $Q_i$ and $P_i$ are the consumption and production rates already
discussed above. $U_i$ is the rate at which biomass remains
unassimilated and $R_i$ is the respiration rate, i.e., the rate at which
biomass is lost. Both Ecopath and mizer assume that the unassimilated
biomass is a fixed proportion of the consumed biomass. In mizer this
parameter is called $1-\alpha_i$ so that $Q_i-U_i=\alpha Q_i$. Therefore
the first master equation can be seen as an equation for the respiration
rate:

$$
R_i=\alpha Q_i-P_i.
$$

So respiration $R$ contains all the losses of accumulated biomass.

In mizer there are two such sources: the metabolic respiration and the
loss due to gonad production that does not result in offspring biomass.

The rate of metabolic respiration is calculated by
`getMetabolicRespiration()` as

$$
K_i = \int_{w_0}^{w_{max}}k_i(w)N_i(w)dw,
$$

where $k_i(w)$ is the metabolic rate of an individual of species $i$ of
weight $w$ and $N_i(w)$ is the number density of such individuals.

The rate of loss due to reproduction is the difference between the rate
of investment into reproduction (the gonadic production rate obtained
with `getGonadProduction()`) and the rate of creation of offspring
biomass (obtained with `getOffspringProduction()`). This difference is
returned by `getReproductionLoss()`.

The total respiration rate is returned by `getRespiration()`.

#### Size-resolved first master equation

Ecopath does not explicitly include gonadal growth. Production is
thought of essentially as somatic production and respiration is thought
of essentially as metabolic respiration. The first master equation can
then be written as $P_{s.i}=\alpha Q_i - K_i$. If we similarly ignore
investment into gonads in mizer, then mizer has an equivalent to this
master equation acting at the level of the individual:

$$
g_i(w) = \alpha_i q_i(w) - k_i(w).
$$

However because of investment into reproduction, which is proportional
to growth in mizer, the first master equation at the level of the
individual becomes

$$
g_i(w) = (1-\psi_i(w))(\alpha_i q_i(w) - k_i(w)),
$$

i.e., the individual only invests a proportion $1-\psi_i(w)$ of its
surplus biomass into somatic growth and the the remaining proportion
$\psi_i(w)$ gets invested into gonadic growth. Unfortunately Ecopath
tells us nothing about how to choose this proportion $\psi_i(w)$.

### Second master equation

The second master equation expresses that the produced biomass is either
lost again to predation or to emigration or it is accumulated:

$$
P_i = M2_i\cdot B_i+C_i+BA_i+E_i+M0_i\cdot B_i.
$$

Here $M2_i$ is the predation mortality rate so that $M2_i\cdot B_i$ is
the rate at which biomass is lost to predation. This is calculated in
mizer by `getM2B()`. Similarly $M0_i$ is the rate of mortality due to
causes other than the predation in the model and the resulting rate of
biomass loss $M0_i\cdot B_i$ is calculated in mizer by `getM0B()`. As
discussed above, $C_i$ is the rate at which biomass is lost to fishing.
It is often expressed as $F_i\cdot B_i$ where $F_i$ is the fishing
mortality rate. $E_i$ is the rate at which biomass is lost due to
emigration (if $E_i$ is negative it would correspond to immigration) and
$BA_i$ is the rate at which biomass is accumulated.

We will simplify matter and restrict to models without emigration and
biomass accumulation. Then this second master equation says that the
production rate is equal to the biomass loss due to the various sources
of mortality: $P_i = Z_i\cdot B_i$ where $Z_i = M2_i+F_i+M0_i$ is the
total mortality rate. In fact, when estimating the production rate for
an Ecopath model, one usually estimates the mortality rate instead.

#### Size-resolved second master equation

Mizer keeps track not only of how biomass is produced and then removed
through mortality, it also keeps track of how biomass is moved from
small sizes to larger sizes. Thus it has a size-resolved version of the
second master equation:

$$
g_i(w)N_i(w) - \frac{d}{dw}\left(g_i(w)w N_i(w)\right) = \mu_i(w) w N_i(w),
$$

where $\mu_i(w)$ is the mortality rate of an individual. When integrated
over all sizes the first term gives the somatic production $P_{s.i}$ and
the second term gives the offspring production.

## Fixing mizer parameters

As we have seen, the Ecopath parameters Biomass, Consumption, Production
and Catch are emergent properties in mizer and can be calculated only
once the size-dependent densities $N_i(w)$ are known. In the steady
state these densities in turn can be calculated from the size-dependent
growth rates $g_i(w)$ and mortality rates $\mu_i(w)$ as $$
N_i(w)=N(w_0)\frac{g(w_0)}{g(w)}\exp\left(-\int_{w_0}^w \frac{\mu_i(w')}{g_i(w)}dw'\right).
$$

These rates $g_i(w)$ and $\mu_i(w)$ depend on the mizer parameters that
we want to determine.

As we said in the introduction, we are making allometric assumptions
that simplify the expressions for the rates in the steady state. For the
mortality rates we have
